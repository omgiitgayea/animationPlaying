/**
 * Create a Javascript program that continuously asks a user for 5 numbers (look at prompt in Javascript) that are comma separated
 * The program should show the same numbers but sorted. If user inputs 'done', then stop program
 * - Cannot use array.sort()
 * - Must use an array, a loop, a conditional
 *
 * Optional
 * - check if there are actually 5 numbers
 * - check if they are actually numbers
 *
 * Things to consider:
 * - convert string to an array of numbers (since I'm checking that they elements are all numbers)
